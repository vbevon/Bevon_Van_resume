				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					I'm Bevon, thanks for checking out my Portfolio. I'm here to to bring
					your vision to life. Like a chef, I enjoy it when people are impressed
					by my work. Let me know what you would like and I will prepare it in
					my metaphorical kitchen and I'm sure you will like what I put infront
					of you. I have done a few projects that you might like to see. Check
					it out.
				</p>
				<p>
					When I'm not working on your dream I enjoy doing some street
					photography. I'm definitely not a professional but I enjoy capturing
					people in their daily life. It can sometimes be intimidating to get
					out there and snap shots of random people but I enjoy it seeing the
					end product.
				</p>
				<p>
					As you may have guessed I also enjoy spending time in the kitchen.
					It's fun trying new baking recipes and cooking up a storm. I have a
					sourdough starter named Kevin, although, I haven't made a sourdough
					bread yet. I am still working up the courage HAHA. Don't worry, I am a
					huam just like you so get in touch if you think I can help.

			<h2>Where I've Been</h2>
			<p>
				My journey in web development didn't start until a few years ago.
				Straight out of high school I went to university for a couple of years,
				but it just wasn't for me. I then started working in the security sector
				and moved on from there to a digital outsource company. My wife and I
				decided to a bit of travelling and I've been doing web development ever
				since. All my work experience included some sort of customer service and
				I am generally a peoples person, so don't worry, I got you &#128521;.
			</p>

		<div class="sectionStyling">
			<h2>What I can do</h2>
			<p>
				I specialize in using the MERN stack. If you don't know what that is
				that's ok. Just know that I can get the job done &#128524;. I can
				develop your front and back-end so we can always have a clear vision of
				the bigger picture.

							This is an ecommerce platform for all street photographers to sell
							their art. A lot of time effort and risk is taken in capturing
							their images and we believe they should be rewarded. We also
							believe that you should have the opportunity to purchase these
							photos at a reasonable price.
